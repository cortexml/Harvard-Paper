The paper has also been mentioned in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2015/08/28/how-two-harvard-grads-want-to-change-the-face-of-health-insurance/#62881bea4d6a), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/...honeyinsured/414765/), [CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/28/whos-charging-more-for-obamacare-plans-surprise.html).

The steps referenced in the ipynb file correspond to the steps in our paper.

Key findings:

1. The largest insurance company in each state on average increased their rates 75% more than smaller insurers in the same state

2. The largest insurance companies do not appear to be paying for higher medical costs per premium dollar versus smaller insurers in the reported experience period of 2013

Impact:

Cited in both House and Senate testimonies, caused Center for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) to conduct an emergency review and revision of insurance companies' risk corridor data.
